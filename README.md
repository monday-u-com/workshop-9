### Workshop DB setup
Execute the following command to run the container with new DB:

docker run --name mysql_workshop \\
-p 3306:3306 \\
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password \\
-e MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=% \\
-e MYSQL_DATABASE=mysql_workshop \\
-d mysql/mysql-server

This will create a docker container running a mysql db named "mysql_workshop".

Let's connect to the DB using mysql workbench.

Create new connection in mysql workbench, configure and test your connection:
